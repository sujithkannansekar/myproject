<h1 class="heading">Cancellation policy</h1>
<br><br>
      <p>  Cancellation policies on hotel booking pages vary depending on the hotel or booking platform. While I can provide you with a general idea, it's important to note that specific policies can differ significantly between different hotels and platforms. Here are some common elements you may find in a hotel booking page's cancellation policy:</p>
<br><br>
      <p> 1. Cancellation Deadline: The policy usually specifies a deadline before which you can cancel your reservation without incurring any charges. This deadline is often stated in terms of a specific number of days or hours before the scheduled check-in time.</p>
      <br><br>
      <p> 2. Cancellation Fees: If you cancel your reservation after the specified deadline, the hotel or booking platform may impose a cancellation fee. This fee can vary depending on factors such as the hotel's policy, the length of the stay, and the proximity to the check-in date. The fee is typically a percentage of the total booking cost or a fixed amount.</p>
      <br><br>
      <p> 3. Non-Refundable Bookings: Some hotel booking pages offer non-refundable bookings at a discounted rate. If you choose this option, it means that you will not be eligible for any refund, even if you cancel your reservation.</p>
      <br><br>
      <p> 4. Partial Cancellations: In some cases, the hotel booking page may allow you to cancel only a portion of your reservation. For example, if you booked multiple rooms, you might be able to cancel some but not all of them. The policy should clarify whether partial cancellations are permitted and any associated fees.</p>
      <br><br>
      <p> 5. Special Rates or Packages: If you booked a special rate or package through the hotel booking page, the cancellation policy may have specific rules regarding these bookings. These rules might differ from the standard policy, so it's important to review the terms and conditions carefully.</p>
      <br><br>
      <p> 6. Refund Processing Time: The cancellation policy may provide an estimate of how long it takes for the refund to be processed and credited back to your original payment method. This timeframe can vary depending on the hotel or booking platform.</p>
      <br><br>
      <p> It's crucial to read and understand the specific cancellation policy provided by the hotel or booking platform before making a reservation. This will help you make an informed decision and be aware of any potential fees or restrictions associated with canceling your booking.</p>
